# .cursor/scratchpad.md - Maya Protocol Arbitrage Scanner

## Background and Motivation

**MAJOR PROJECT PIVOT: Fresh Start - Generative Block Prediction Model using Mayanode API**

The project is undergoing a significant pivot. All previous work on transaction-level prediction using Midgard API data (Phases 1-5) is now **SUPERSEDED**.
The new goal is to build a **Generative Block Prediction Model**. This involves:
1.  Fetching full block data directly from the Mayanode API (`https://mayanode.mayachain.info/mayachain/doc`).
2.  The model will aim to predict the *entire next block*.
3.  Arbitrage identification will be an emergent property.

The Mayanode REST API endpoint `/mayachain/block` provides transactions as pre-decoded JSON. However, other sources like the Tendermint RPC endpoint (`/block` or `/unconfirmed_txs`) provide base64 encoded protobuf strings for transactions (typically `cosmos.tx.v1beta1.Tx`). Thus, a robust protobuf decoding capability is essential for handling these sources.

**Protobuf Decoding Journey Summary:**
Initial attempts to decode these transactions using standard Python `protobuf` library and various `protoc` versions were unsuccessful.
The breakthrough for `cosmos.tx.v1beta1.Tx` (from Tendermint RPC) came from:
1.  Using `betterproto` to generate Python stubs from a curated set of `.proto` files (Cosmos SDK, gogoproto, google protos).
2.  Installing specific versions of dependencies: `protobuf==4.21.12` (compatible with `betterproto==2.0.0b7`), `betterproto[compiler]==2.0.0b7`, and `grpclib`.
3.  Compiling protos using `python -m grpc_tools.protoc ... --python_betterproto_out=...`.
This allows native Python deserialization of `CosmosTx` messages.

For more complex, Mayanode-specific types like `types.MsgObservedTxOut` (which historically caused significant issues):
1.  Using the exact `.proto` files from a specific Mayanode source commit (`59743feb...` from mid-2023) was key.
2.  The correct outer message type was identified as `types.MsgObservedTxOut`.
3.  A manual modification to `Tx.chain` field (from `string` to `bytes`) in the source `common.proto` was necessary.
4.  `protoc --decode=types.MsgObservedTxOut ...` (e.g., v3.20.1) then successfully parsed these messages.
5.  Native Python deserialization with standard libraries still failed for these complex types.
6.  A workaround using `subprocess` to call `protoc --decode` from Python and parse its text output was implemented (`scripts/decode_local_block_for_comparison.py`) and remains a documented fallback for such specific cases.

**Resolution of `signer` Field Issue & Caching Mystery (Key Learning):**
A persistent issue where the `signer` field in decoded Tendermint transactions (specifically in `body.messages[0].signer`) was not being correctly populated by deriving it from `authInfo.signerInfos` has been **RESOLVED**.
The root causes were twofold:
1.  **Test Data:** The primary test transaction string being used likely resulted in an `AuthInfo` object that was empty or `None` *after* the initial `CosmosTx().parse()` step. When `betterproto`'s `to_dict(include_default_values=False)` was called on such an empty `AuthInfo` object, it would correctly yield an empty dictionary, leading to no `signerInfos` being available for the derivation logic.
2.  **Python Caching/Environment:** A significant challenge was a suspected Python caching or environment issue that prevented updates to `src/common_utils.py` (especially new `print` statements) from being reflected when `scripts/compare_block_data.py` was run. This was resolved by:
    *   Clearing `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files.
    *   Temporarily using a faulty import in `compare_block_data.py` to confirm it *was* reading the latest `common_utils.py` (it crashed as expected).
    *   Finally, isolating the test by creating a new script (`temp_test_common_utils.py`) and running it in a fresh terminal, which consistently showed the latest code changes.
Once a new test transaction string (known to contain `signer_infos`) was used with the fresh environment, the existing `signer` derivation logic in `src/common_utils.py` was confirmed to be working correctly.

**Current Goal for Protobuf:**
-   **Primary Solution for Tendermint Tx (`CosmosTx`):** Utilize the `betterproto`-generated stubs for native Python deserialization. This is now implemented and **VALIDATED, including correct `signer` field population.**
-   **Fallback for Complex/Specific Mayanode Types (e.g., `MsgObservedTxOut`):** Rely on the documented `subprocess` method calling `protoc --decode`, as detailed in `Docs/Python_Protobuf_Decoding_Guide_Mayanode.md`.
-   The workspace now contains the necessary `proto/src` and `proto/generated/pb_stubs` (which should be committed to Git) for the `betterproto` approach.

**Current Project State & Performance:**
The data ingestion pipeline and the Flask web application are now highly performant. Optimizations in `src/database_utils.py` for block reconstruction (pre-fetching messages and events) have drastically reduced API response times. The `/api/latest-blocks-data` endpoint, which reconstructs block details, now responds in the **5-9ms range for individual blocks and ~1.7-3 seconds for 10 blocks, meeting arbitrage performance requirements.** The Flask app successfully displays latest blocks and live mempool data with efficient updates.

## Key Challenges and Analysis (NEW - For Block Prediction)

-   **Mayanode API Interaction:** Robust interaction with Mayanode API for block data. (Largely addressed)
-   **Tendermint RPC for Mempool & Blocks:** Successfully fetching unconfirmed Txs and full blocks. (Addressed)
-   **API Response Variability (`/mayachain/block`):** Understood; Mayanode REST provides decoded JSON, Tendermint RPC provides protobuf.
-   **Protobuf Deserialization (Native Python):**
    -   For `cosmos.tx.v1beta1.Tx` from Tendermint RPC: **VALIDATED** using `betterproto`, including robust handling of `auth_info` and derivation of `signer` fields.
    -   For complex Mayanode-specific types like `types.MsgObservedTxOut`: Addressed via documented fallback (`subprocess` with `protoc --decode`).
-   **Handling Empty Blocks:** Addressed in parsing logic.
-   **Toolchain for Protobuf:**
    -   **Primary:** `betterproto[compiler]==2.0.0b7`, `protobuf==4.21.12`, `grpclib`, and `python -m grpc_tools.protoc` for generating stubs for `CosmosTx`.
    -   **Fallback/Diagnostic:** Standalone `protoc` (e.g., v3.20.1) for `protoc --decode` with specific Mayanode protos.
-   **Python Environment/Caching:** Previously a challenge, now understood and mitigated through direct testing and cache clearing when necessary.
-   **Complex JSON Reconstruction:** Designing and implementing the logic to accurately reconstruct the nested JSON structure of a Mayanode API block from purely relational database tables was a complex task. This has been **successfully implemented and highly optimized** in `src/database_utils.py`. Query performance for this function is now excellent.

## Database Design Philosophy (NEW)

-   **Core: Transaction Ledger:** The blockchain is fundamentally a transaction ledger. The database schema reflects this by centering around `blocks` and `transactions` tables, with other tables linking to them.
-   **Normalization & Relational Purity:** The schema aims for a **fully relational design** to maximize data integrity, query flexibility, and adherence to database best practices. All discrete data points from blocks, transactions, messages, events, and their attributes will be stored in dedicated tables and columns. **No raw JSON blobs for transactions or their sub-components will be stored directly in the database.**
-   **Relational Integrity:** Foreign key constraints are defined to maintain relationships between tables (e.g., a transaction must belong to a valid block, an event attribute must belong to a valid event).
-   **JSON Reconstruction on Demand:** Complex JSON structures, such as the original Mayanode API block response, will be **reconstructed by querying the relational tables and assembling the data in Python**. A key utility (`reconstruct_block_as_mayanode_api_json`) will be responsible for this.
-   **Querying for Account History:** Account transaction history is derived by querying the `transaction_address_link` table for a given address, then joining with `transactions` and `blocks` to retrieve detailed information. The `addresses` table (with `first_seen`/`last_seen`) provides a summary but links are definitive.
-   **Data for AI:** While the stored schema is normalized, data will be denormalized via joins during preprocessing for AI model training to create comprehensive feature sets. The relational source allows flexible feature engineering.
-   **Comprehensive Data Storage:** The goal is to store all relevant data from blocks. Complex nested JSON objects (like message bodies or event attributes) are stored as JSON strings (TEXT) in SQLite for now. Future migration to PostgreSQL could leverage JSONB for more advanced querying within these structures. **REVISED: All data points will be stored in discrete fields. JSON strings will not be used for structured data within the database; reconstruction of original JSON is done on demand.**

## High-level Task Breakdown

**Phases 1-5: Transaction-Level Prediction (Midgard API) - SUPERSEDED**
*   All tasks related to fetching data from Midgard and predicting individual transactions are now considered superseded by the new block-level prediction approach using the Mayanode API.

---

**Phase 0: Project Setup & Prerequisites**
*   **Task 0.1: Setup/Verify Python Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies (COMPLETE)**
    *   **Description:** Ensure a Python virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) is active in the project root. Install or update all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` completes successfully within an activated virtual environment. Key scripts (e.g., `src/api_connections.py`) can import their required libraries without error.

**Phase 10: Foundational Data Pipeline & Flask Application (Mayanode API & Tendermint RPC)**

*   **Task 10.1: Mayanode API Research & Client Implementation (Data Fetching & Next Block Templating) (COMPLETE - VERIFIED)**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Identify and test Mayanode REST API endpoints for confirmed blocks (by height, latest). (COMPLETE - `fetch_mayanode_block` using `https://mayanode.mayachain.info/mayachain/block`)
        *   Identify and test Tendermint RPC endpoints for unconfirmed transactions (mempool) and mempool statistics. (COMPLETE - `fetch_tendermint_unconfirmed_txs`, `get_tendermint_num_unconfirmed_txs` using `https://tendermint.mayachain.info`)
        *   Implement Python functions in `src/api_connections.py` to query these endpoints. (COMPLETE)
        *   Implement `construct_next_block_template()` in `src/api_connections.py`. (COMPLETE)
        *   Update `src/fetch_realtime_transactions.py` for downloading historical blocks. (COMPLETE)
        *   Update `Docs/Mayanode_API_Cheat_Sheet.md`. (COMPLETE)
    *   Success Criteria: Able to fetch and save data for specific blocks, latest block, and current mempool. `construct_next_block_template` produces a valid template.

*   **Task 10.2.A: Block & Transaction Data Parsing Logic (`common_utils.py`) & Comparison (`compare_block_data.py`) (COMPLETE & VERIFIED)**
    *   Sub-tasks:
        *   Enhance `scripts/compare_block_data.py`:
            *   Make `BLOCK_HEIGHT` a command-line argument. (COMPLETE)
            *   Implement a dedicated transaction-by-transaction comparison function. (COMPLETE)
            *   Implement a full parsed block structure comparison function. (COMPLETE)
        *   Run `scripts/compare_block_data.py` for a test block (e.g., 11320570) and analyze differences. (COMPLETE)
            *   **Finding 1 (Transaction Content):** The `compare_transaction_lists` function shows a **MATCH** for all 22 transactions in block 11320570 after Tendermint transactions are decoded and transformed. This validates the core Protobuf decoding and transformation logic in `src/common_utils.py`.
            *   **Finding 2 (Parsed Fee Attribute):** The `compare_full_parsed_blocks` function initially showed a type mismatch for `transactions[X].result_events_parsed[0].attributes.fee` (string from Mayanode API vs. None from Tendermint RPC).
                *   Investigation revealed that the Tendermint RPC `/block_results` for this block provides `value: null` for the `fee` attribute in the raw `tx` event.
                *   The `AuthInfo.fee.amount` list in the decoded Protobuf transaction was also empty for these transactions.
                *   Therefore, `src/common_utils.py` correctly parses the Tendermint event fee as `None` and, finding no fee in `AuthInfo` to populate it from, leaves it as `None`.
                *   This mismatch is a genuine data presentation difference between the Mayanode API (which provides a fee string) and the combination of Tendermint RPC + AuthInfo (which don't for this block/tx type). The parsing accurately reflects this. A comment was added to `common_utils.py` to document this.
            *   **Finding 3 (Other Parsed Block Diffs):** Other differences in `compare_full_parsed_blocks` (e.g., `end_block_events_raw`, `transactions_raw_base64`, `transactions_source`, raw event structures within `transactions[X].result_events_raw`) are understood to be artifacts of how the two different data sources present their raw data or how `parse_confirmed_block` stores source-specific raw information. The *parsed transactions* themselves align.
    *   Success Criteria: `scripts/compare_block_data.py` runs successfully, producing detailed comparison reports. The core transaction decoding and transformation logic is validated. Differences in full block structures are understood and documented, distinguishing between parsing issues and genuine data source variations. (ACHIEVED)

*   **Task 10.2.B: Database Implementation and Data Ingestion Pipeline (Relational Refactor) (COMPLETE & VERIFIED)**
    *   **Description:**
        *   Design a **fully relational** database schema (e.g., using SQLite initially) to store every component of parsed confirmed block data. This includes block headers, individual transactions (core details like hash, index, success status), transaction messages (with type, index within transaction, and links to message-specific detail tables), message-specific attributes (e.g., sender, recipient, amounts, memo for `MsgSend`; details for `MsgSwap`, `MsgDeposit`, `MsgOutboundTx`, etc., likely in separate tables per message type or a structured EAV-like model if message types are too diverse), transaction-level events (type, index, attributes), event attributes (key, value, index, potentially nested if necessary and manageable), block-level events (begin/end block, type, attributes), unique addresses involved in transactions/events, and any other discrete data points. **No raw JSON blobs for transactions, messages, or events will be stored.**
        *   Implement Python functions in `src/database_utils.py` for:
            *   Database initialization (`create_tables`) with the fully relational schema.
            *   Granular data insertion functions for each distinct entity (e.g., `insert_block_header`, `insert_transaction_core`, `insert_transaction_message_base`, `insert_msg_send_details`, `insert_event`, `insert_event_attribute`, `insert_address_link`, etc.). These will be orchestrated by a main `insert_block_and_components` function.
            *   Comprehensive query functions to retrieve data for analysis and reconstruction.
            *   A key function: `reconstruct_block_as_mayanode_api_json(conn, block_height)` that queries all relevant tables and meticulously reassembles the complete block JSON structure to match the Mayanode API's `/mayachain/block` output as closely as feasible.
        *   Modify `src/fetch_realtime_transactions.py` (or create a new `src/data_ingestion_service.py`) to:
            *   Continuously poll the Mayanode API for new confirmed blocks (compared to the latest in DB).
            *   Implement a configurable delay (e.g., 5-10 seconds) between polls to respect API rate limits.
            *   Fetch, parse (using 10.2.A logic), and **insert new confirmed block data by decomposing it into the new relational database schema using the updated `database_utils.py` functions.**
            *   Ensure the system avoids redundant API calls for data already present in the local database.
        *   Develop utility functions to query the database, including constructing an address's transaction history from locally stored transactions.
        *   **Mempool Data Strategy:** For inference, live mempool data will be fetched on demand (as per `construct_next_block_template` in `api_connections.py`). Storing historical mempool snapshots in the database is a secondary consideration if a clear need for training/analysis emerges.
    *   **Success Criteria:**
        *   A SQLite database is created with a **fully relational schema capable of storing all discrete data points from a Mayanode block.** (ACHIEVED)
        *   The data ingestion script (`fetch_realtime_transactions.py`) continuously and politely populates the database with new confirmed blocks, correctly decomposing them into the relational schema. (ACHIEVED)
        *   The `reconstruct_block_as_mayanode_api_json` function in `database_utils.py` can successfully query the database for a given block height and produce a JSON output that is a structural and informational **carbon copy** (as much as feasible) of the Mayanode API's response for that block. (ACHIEVED & HIGHLY OPTIMIZED)
        *   Data can be queried efficiently for various analytical purposes. (ACHIEVED)
        *   The system avoids redundant API calls for confirmed blocks. (ACHIEVED)

*   **Task 10.2.C: Protobuf Decoding Setup & Implementation (COMPLETE & VALIDATED)**
    *   **Overall Objective:** Achieve reliable native Python deserialization for `cosmos.tx.v1beta1.Tx` from Tendermint RPC, ensuring the transformed output matches the Mayanode API transaction structure. Have a documented fallback for complex Mayanode-specific types.
    *   **Current Status & Approach:**
        *   **For `cosmos.tx.v1beta1.Tx` (Tendermint RPC):** Successfully implemented and **VALIDATED** using `betterproto` generated Python stubs. The `decode_cosmos_tx_string_to_dict` and `transform_decoded_tm_tx_to_mayanode_format` functions in `src/common_utils.py` now produce output that matches the Mayanode API's JSON structure for transactions (tested with all 22 transactions in Mayanode block 11320570). This includes correct `signer` field population and alignment of other fields. The necessary `.proto` files are in `proto/src/`, generated stubs in `proto/generated/pb_stubs/`.
        *   **For `types.MsgObservedTxOut` (and similar complex Mayanode types):** The `subprocess` method calling `protoc --decode` (using specific Mayanode protos from commit `59743feb...` and the `Tx.chain` fix) remains the reliable fallback. This is demonstrated in `scripts/decode_local_block_for_comparison.py`.
        *   Both methods are documented in `Docs/Python_Protobuf_Decoding_Guide_Mayanode.md`.
    *   **Sub-Tasks:**
        *   **Task 10.2.C.1: Curate `.proto` files for `betterproto` (COMPLETE)**
        *   **Task 10.2.C.2: Generate Python stubs using `betterproto` (COMPLETE)**
        *   **Task 10.2.C.3: Integrate `betterproto` stubs for `CosmosTx` decoding (COMPLETE & VALIDATED)**
        *   **Task 10.2.C.4: Document `protoc --decode` fallback for `MsgObservedTxOut` (COMPLETE)**
        *   **Task 10.2.C.9: Experimentation - Alternative Python Protobuf Deserialization (COMPLETE - `betterproto` validated for CosmosTx, `subprocess` validated for MsgObservedTxOut)**
    *   **Success Criteria:** `cosmos.tx.v1beta1.Tx` messages from Tendermint RPC are reliably decoded and transformed in Python to match the Mayanode API's transaction JSON structure, including correct population of the `signer` field and other structural alignments. A robust, documented method exists for handling other problematic types. (ACHIEVED)

*   **Task 10.2.D: Flask App for Real-time Block & Mempool Display (COMPLETE & VERIFIED)**

        *   A main page (`templates/latest_blocks.html`) that dynamically loads and displays the 10 newest blocks from the database.
        *   The block display should update automatically, fetching newer blocks since the last known height.
        *   A separate section on the page to display live mempool transactions, refreshing periodically.
        *   API endpoints in `app.py` (`/api/latest-blocks-data`, `/api/blocks-since/<height>`, `/api/mempool`) to serve data to the frontend.
        *   Responsive UI design.
    *   **Sub-Tasks & Status**:
        *   **10.2.D.1: Basic Flask App & Initial Block Display**: Create `app.py` and `latest_blocks.html`. Implement `get_latest_blocks_with_details` in `database_utils.py`. **(COMPLETE)**
        *   **10.2.D.2: Dynamic Block Loading**: Implement `/api/latest-blocks-data` and `/api/blocks-since/<height>` endpoints. Update JavaScript for dynamic fetching and rendering, ensuring only the 10 newest blocks are shown and sorted correctly. **(COMPLETE)**
        *   **10.2.D.3: UI Enhancements & Responsiveness**: Implement collapsible sections for block details, improve styling, and ensure responsive design for different screen sizes. **(COMPLETE)**
        *   **10.2.D.4: Database Performance Optimization (Task 9 from old plan - Merged here)**:
            *   **Goal**: Significantly reduce time for `reconstruct_block_as_mayanode_api_json`.
            *   Modify `_get_formatted_transactions_for_block` to pre-fetch messages and events.
            *   Modify worker function (`_format_single_tx_worker_entrypoint`) to use pre-fetched data.
            *   Enable WAL mode for SQLite.
            *   Add indexes to `events` and `event_attributes` tables.
            *   **Outcome**: Achieved. API responses are now extremely fast (e.g., 5-9ms for single block reconstruction). **(COMPLETE)**
        *   **10.2.D.5: Mempool Monitoring Display (Task 10 from old plan - Merged here)**:
            *   Create `/api/mempool` endpoint in `app.py` using `fetch_decoded_tendermint_mempool_txs`.
            *   Update `latest_blocks.html` JavaScript to fetch and render mempool data dynamically.
            *   Style the mempool display.
            *   **Outcome**: Live mempool data is displayed and updates correctly. **(COMPLETE)**
    *   **Success Criteria**:
        *   Flask application (`app.py`) serves block and mempool data via API endpoints. **(ACHIEVED)**
        *   `templates/latest_blocks.html` dynamically displays the 10 latest blocks, fetches new blocks efficiently, and shows live mempool activity. **(ACHIEVED)**
        *   UI is responsive and user-friendly. **(ACHIEVED)**
        *   Block reconstruction (`reconstruct_block_as_mayanode_api_json`) and associated API endpoints are highly performant, meeting arbitrage requirements (5-9ms response times for single block data). **(ACHIEVED)**

- **`common_utils.py` Refinements:** Removed unused `_parse_event_attributes`, improved `parse_iso_datetime` and `transform_decoded_tm_tx_to_mayanode_format`, enhanced `camel_to_snake`, and added more tests.
- **Flask App (`app.py`) Enhancements (Task 10.2.D):**
    - Implemented API endpoints for dynamic block loading (`/api/latest-blocks-data`, `/api/blocks-since/<height>`).
    - Implemented API endpoint for mempool data (`/api/mempool`).
    - Improved JavaScript in `latest_blocks.html` for rendering blocks and mempool data, including responsive design and UI fixes.
    - **Achieved Arbitrage-Ready Performance:** Optimized `reconstruct_block_as_mayanode_api_json` and related database queries (Task 10.2.D.4 - previously Task 9) resulting in **~5-9ms API response times for individual block data and ~1.7-3s for 10 blocks.**
    - Integrated dynamic mempool display into `latest_blocks.html` (Task 10.2.D.5 - previously Task 10).

- **The next major focus is Phase 11: Generative Block Prediction Model.** This will start with **Task 11.1: Preprocessing for Block Prediction (`preprocess_ai_data.py`)**.

**Upcoming Tasks (Phase 11):**
-   Task 11.1: Preprocessing for Block Prediction (`preprocess_ai_data.py`)
-   Task 11.2: Adapt Generative Model for Block Prediction (`model.py`)
-   Task 11.3: Update Training Script for Block Model (`train_model.py`)
-   Task 11.4: Develop Evaluation Suite for Block Model (`evaluate_model_block.py`)
-   Task 11.5: Develop Realtime Inference Suite for Block Prediction (`realtime_inference_block.py`)
-   Task 11.6: Iteration, Refinement, and Documentation (Phase 11)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
-   The Flask application (`app.py`) is fully functional, displaying latest blocks and mempool activity with excellent performance. Database reconstruction is extremely fast (5-9ms per block).
-   All previously identified issues regarding block display, duplicate blocks, logging verbosity, and performance bottlenecks have been resolved.
-   Ready to proceed with Phase 11: AI Model Development, starting with Task 11.1 (Data Preprocessing).

-   **Python Module Execution:** Scripts intended to be part of a package... (unchanged)
-   **Linter Error Iteration:** If linter errors persist... (unchanged)
-   **Focus on One Task:** When in Executor mode... (unchanged)
-   **Scratchpad for Resilience:** The IDE (Cursor) can be unstable... (unchanged)
-   **`tqdm` for Clean CLI Progress:** For long-running batch processes... (unchanged)
-   **Verbose Logging Control:** Debug print statements are useful... (unchanged)
-   **Database Optimization Impact:** Pre-fetching data (messages, events) for batch processing within `_get_formatted_transactions_for_block` and enabling WAL mode with appropriate indexing dramatically reduced database query overhead, leading to substantial API performance improvements.
-   **Client-Side Logic for UI:** Carefully managing client-side JavaScript for fetching, sorting, and displaying data is crucial for a smooth user experience, especially when dealing with dynamically updating lists like blocks. Ensuring correct data manipulation (e.g., filtering duplicates, sorting, trimming) prevents visual glitches.

## Current Context / Last Task Worked On

**Overall Goal:** Build a generative block prediction model using Mayanode API and Tendermint RPC data. The foundational data pipeline (fetching, parsing, storage, optimized retrieval) and a high-performance Flask visualization app are now complete.

**Current Phase:** Completed Phase 10 (Data Pipeline & Flask App). Preparing to start Phase 11 (AI Model Development).

**Last Major Task Group Completed (Phase 10, specifically Task 10.2.D - Flask App & Optimizations):**
-   **`src/database_utils.py`:**
    -   Highly optimized `reconstruct_block_as_mayanode_api_json` (and its helper `_get_formatted_transactions_for_block`) by pre-fetching messages and events. This resulted in API response times of 5-9ms for block data.
    -   Ensured WAL mode is active and added relevant indexes.
-   **`app.py`:**
    -   Implemented `/api/mempool` endpoint.
    -   Ensured all API endpoints benefit from the optimized database queries.
    -   Refined logging and error handling.
-   **`templates/latest_blocks.html`:**
    -   Integrated mempool display with dynamic updates.
    -   Fixed UI issues related to block list management (duplicates, sorting, max display).
    -   Ensured responsive design for mempool and block sections.
-   **`src/api_connections.py` & `src/common_utils.py`:**
    -   Minor refinements and ensuring stability for Flask app usage.

**Reasoning:** The primary goal was to finalize and optimize the Flask application for displaying blocks and mempool data, achieving performance suitable for arbitrage monitoring as a benchmark. This involved deep optimization of database interactions and refining the frontend JavaScript.

**Awaiting User Input:** Confirmation to proceed with Phase 11: AI Model Development, starting with Task 11.1 (Data Preprocessing).

## Last Task Worked On Context
*   **Last Task:** Completed Phase 10 by finalizing Flask app log verbosity and preparing for the next phase. Corrected an overreach in updating Phase 11 objectives in the scratchpad.
*   **Current Focus:** Transitioning to Phase 11 - Generative Block Prediction Model. The immediate next step is to start **Task 11.1: Preprocessing for Block Prediction (`preprocess_ai_data.py`)**.
